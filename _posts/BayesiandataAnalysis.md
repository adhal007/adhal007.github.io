## Data Science and Patterns:

#### **Introduction**

Over the years, different technological fields had advanced into high dimensional data collection methods experimentally, providing observations for a plethora of measurement techniques. For beginners like me, trying to enter into this ever increasing domain of dimensionality, a firm ground to understand the basic principles of data science problems forms the crux. Data science can be majorly factored into two subsets, each of which i will ponder upon in detail with time to give some necessary details for different backgrounds to understand what role might be a consistent fit (neither an overfit, nor an underfit). For now, it is easy to interpret the two major categories in the data science domain as Application and Development, each with their pros and cons. 

#### **Theoretical framework for Data science**

A deeper dive into this ocean of data, is a swim amongst theoretical conceptions which come in the broad form of mathematics, and a comprehensive form of Statistics and Probability. They form the base for any framework in both application as well as development of data science methodlogies. Since these high dimensional data are immersed in patterns; Statistics and Probability are the tools to provide an intuitive understanding of how these patterns exist and thus our enhanced extrapolation of these patterns. With an advancement in the field of computer science since the 1960's, our modern age systems have the power and the memory to perform large scale data computations in almost linear or log-linear scales for most types of data transformations. There are widely available softwares to assist this new hobby of what we call 'DATA-MINING' and eventually use these data patterns towards a form of prediction-modelling.
