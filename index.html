  <span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon"></span>
  I'm a data scientist, with 5+ years of expertise in statistical design, modeling and analysis of high dimensional data-sets. At <a href="https://serimmune.com" target="_blank"><strong>Serimmune</strong></a>. I 
  most recently worked on statistical modeling of Long-Covid immune response using unbiased ML models.Currently, I'm also building a streamlined codebase for different ML, DL and bioinformatics analysis tools <a href="https://abhilashdhal.com/projects" target="_blank"><strong>OmixHub</strong></a>. I have an MS in 
  <strong>Biophysics</strong> from the University of California (supervised by the awesome
  <a href="http://qtl.rocks/chenglab.html" target="_blank">Professor Hao Cheng</a>) and my Bachelor of <strong>Biochemical Engineering</strong> from 
  IIT-BHU, India. My masters thesis project involved
  <a href="https://github.com/adhal007/SSBR-JWAS-Implementation" target="_blank">Statistical analysis of GWAS by bayesian methods</a>.
